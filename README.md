This is the *Hyperblog HTML* project I made myself.

You have likely come across numerous blogs on the internet. Blogs serve as a widely-used medium for individuals to express their thoughts and ideas. They cover a wide range of topics, including sports, science, art, and more. In this project, your objective is to create a blog template website using only HTML. The blog can be about any subject of your choice.
